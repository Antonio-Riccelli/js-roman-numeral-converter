 freeCodecamp.org second project challenge from the JavaScript algorithms and data structures curriculum.

 The basic logic of the converter is:

 - Break down the provided number (function argument) in ones, tens, hundreds and thousands, and pass these as elements of a new array
 - Use a loop to iterate through the elements and look up the equivalent Roman number, which is stored in an array of objects
 - Add the correspondent number to a new array, which is then converted to a string and returned

 Currently only in JS form, I will soon complete the graphical part in simple HTML & CSS.
